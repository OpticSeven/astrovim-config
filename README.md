# Nik's AstroNvim Template

Most of AstroNvim is stock including the leader key `space`

I have a few pre-installed packages with custom commands:

Markdown Preview (opens a MarkDown preview of the current file in the browser).

You may need to run this command if it doesn't work!
```
:call mkdp#util#install()
```

and some minor fixes for working with clangd.

**NOTE:** This is for AstroNvim v4+

A template for getting started with [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)
